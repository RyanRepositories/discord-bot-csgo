# discord-bot-csgo
This is a Discord bot to help investors in the game of CS:GO. It shows a price history of a given item. It also has a custom help message and error message.

### NOTE: You have to replace "token" at the bottom of the main.py file with your own Discord API token, as that is what communicates with the Discord API and what makes the Discord bot work. To get your own Discord API token, here is a tutorial by WriteBots: https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/. Never share this token with anyone.

## Price Command - "$price <"skin name"> \<currency>" <br />
